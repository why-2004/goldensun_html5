# Golden Sun Engine - HTML5
An online **Golden Sun Engine** entirely built in HTML5 with [PhaserJS CE 2.15.0](http://phaser.io/).

**See the [DEMO](https://jjppof.github.io/goldensun_html5/index).** Prefer to use Chrome based browsers.

- Feel free to help! Check what I need help [here](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/projects/2). Please, reach me if you want to do so.
- The goal of this project is not to do exactly the same engine as GS, but very similar.
- If you found any bug, please create an issue for it.
- Check the [wiki](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/wiki) for database configuration, tutorials and project information.
- This repository is just the engine. I'm not planning to do maps, animations, items etc. Content here is just enough to show the functionalities.
- I use [projects](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/projects/1) to write down things.
- There's no production environment for now, but I'm planning to do it with webpack and embed most of the assets.

## Running GS-HTML5 on your computer

GS-HTML5 has no external dependency, so there's no `npm install` or packages on CDN, etc. Just clone the project and run it into a http server. I would recommend these steps:
- Clone the project (or download it and extract the files);
- Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it (make sure you add node.js in the system path, default install should do it);
- In the terminal of your computer, install a light http server by running `npm install http-server -g`;
- In the terminal, go to the root folder (use `cd` command: `cd path\to\gshtml5`) of the GS-HTML5 you cloned/downloaded and then run `http-server`;
- Go to your browser (prefer Chrome based browsers) and access the address shown in the terminal (it's probably `http://localhost:8080/`).
- I strongly reccomend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to develop.
